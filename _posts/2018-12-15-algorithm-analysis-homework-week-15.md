## most popular problems on leetcode

![](./image/leetcode-week-15-2.png)

## intro of the question
the problem is that
```
Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.
Example:
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
Note:
Given n will always be valid.
Follow up:
Could you do this in one pass?
```

## prove of work

so this the problem of this week,this problem is all about the lisNode.which is an import data structure of our daily coding because it have some advantake in storage and its very fast to delete or add node in the middle of array.

![](./image/leetcode-week-15-1.png)

and here is the code
```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :type n: int
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        before_delete = head
        n_after_before_delete = head
        for x in range(n):
            n_after_before_delete = n_after_before_delete.next
        if n_after_before_delete ==None:
            return head.next
        while True:
            if n_after_before_delete.next== None:
                before_delete.next = before_delete.next.next
                return head
            before_delete=before_delete.next
            n_after_before_delete=n_after_before_delete.next
            
```


i have to say this result is probably the fastest code i ever done in leetcode. beat almost a hundred percent people who have done this problem.

and the key is that since this problem is kind of simple,so you have to make decision about the best time complexity.

and since its a linked list,and you will have check the all list to find the least n-th node.

so no matter what,the solution(if exists)should one traverse of the whole linked list.

so there is a direction to make the best algorithm now.


and here i present the somehow useful tool called cursor.which is used very offen in linkedlist problem.

the term cursor means that not like always you using one pointer point to the current node and one by one you can check if this node is what you want,then you can add node of remove the next node.

for the cursor it means it keeps two different pointer which keeps the constant distance between each other.

as for how can you make sure it always keeps the same distance is that in the initialize phrase,you set the two pointer at constant distance then you move the two pointer at the same time so you can keep the same distance at always.

for this problem,you will know that the bigest problem is that how can you fine the n-th least node during one traverse,and here we can use cursor to do that,once the later cursor comes to the end which is none,then it means the before cursor point to the right node then you can delete the afterwards node then.
