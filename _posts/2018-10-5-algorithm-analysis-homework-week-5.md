## leet code top popular problem number 7
the problem in below
```
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Example 1:

Input: 123
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: -123
Output: -321
Example 3:

Input: 120
Output: 21
Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
```

the problem is probably the most easiest one i ever met on leetcode,i dont quiet understand why some question this easy can be on the list of most popular question of all time.

so the only trap this problem has is that that it directly make you output should be in the range of -2**31 to 2**31-1.and remember that your output instead of input.

so the solution is kind of self-explained.

which i believe is more likely a junior high school level.

```
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        res = 0 
        tmp = x
        if tmp < 0:
            tmp = -1 * tmp
        while tmp != 0:
            res *= 10
            res += tmp % 10
            tmp = tmp // 10
        if res < -2**31 or res > 2**31-1:
            return 0
        if x < 0:
            return -1 * res
        else:
            return res
```
